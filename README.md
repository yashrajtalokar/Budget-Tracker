# Budget-Tracker

The expense tracker is a user-friendly web application that allows individuals or organizations to manage their expenses and track their budget effectively. It features an intuitive interface created with HTML and CSS, showcasing a list of expenses alongside the remaining budget out of the total allocated budget.
Powered by JavaScript, the expense tracker enables users to add, delete, and categorize expenses seamlessly. The real-time calculations performed by the JavaScript code automatically update the remaining budget as expenses are added or removed, ensuring accurate and up-to-date budget management.
